## What We Discovered

During our recent infrastructure optimization work, we stumbled upon a surprising insight that completely changed how we approach resource allocation decisions. This is the story of how we learned that CPU is significantly more expensive than memory in Google Cloud Platform.

## The Eye-Opening Discovery

### Our Initial Assumption
Like many engineers, we had always assumed that memory was the expensive resource to optimize. The conventional wisdom seemed to be "save memory at all costs" - but we were wrong.

### The Reality Check
When we actually analyzed the pricing for GCP's e2 machine types, the numbers told a different story:

**GCP e2 Machine Type Pricing:**
- **CPU**: $0.02 per vCPU per hour
- **Memory**: $0.0029 per GiB per hour

**The Surprise**: CPU is actually **6.9x more expensive** than memory on a per-resource basis.

This discovery completely flipped our resource optimization strategy on its head.

## How This Changed Our Approach

### The Problem We Were Solving
We had a Java application in production that was struggling with garbage collection performance. The symptoms were classic:
- Response times spiking during GC cycles
- Service becoming unresponsive under load
- Users experiencing intermittent performance issues

### Our Two Solution Paths
We evaluated two different approaches to solve the GC performance problem:

**Option 1: Throw More CPU at It**
- Scale from 1 vCPU to 2 vCPU
- Give the application more processing power to handle GC operations
- Seemed logical at first glance

**Option 2: Give It More Breathing Room**
- Scale memory from 8 GiB to 12 GiB
- Reduce GC frequency by providing more buffer space
- Less intuitive but potentially more cost-effective

### The Cost Analysis That Changed Everything
When we crunched the numbers, the results were eye-opening:

| Approach | CPU Cost | Memory Cost | Total Cost | Cost vs. Baseline |
|----------|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Original** (1 vCPU, 8 GiB) | $0.02 | $0.0232 | $0.0432 | Baseline |
| **CPU Scaling** (2 vCPU, 8 GiB) | $0.04 | $0.0232 | $0.0632 | +46.3% |
| **Memory Scaling** (1 vCPU, 12 GiB) | $0.02 | $0.0348 | $0.0548 | +26.9% |

**The Key Insight**: Memory scaling was **15.4% cheaper** than CPU scaling while solving the same problem!

## What We Learned

### The Memory Scaling Approach Won
We went with the memory scaling solution, and the results exceeded our expectations:
- **Application Stability**: Dramatically reduced performance degradation
- **Cost Savings**: 15.4% cheaper than the CPU scaling alternative
- **Success Rate**: Worked across 95%+ of our SaaS deployments
- **Budget Saved**: Saved us around $40,000 on our monthly budget

### Why This Matters
This experience taught us several valuable lessons:

1. **Question Your Assumptions**: What you think is expensive might not be what's actually expensive
2. **Always Run the Numbers**: Gut feelings about resource costs can be misleading
3. **Cloud Pricing Knowledge**: Understanding your cloud provider's pricing model is crucial for optimization

## How This Changed Our Engineering Practices

### Before This Discovery
- We automatically tried to minimize memory usage
- CPU scaling was our go-to solution for performance issues
- We didn't regularly analyze resource cost ratios

### After This Discovery
- We now start with memory optimization for GC-related issues
- We always calculate the cost implications of different scaling approaches
- We regularly review cloud pricing to identify optimization opportunities
- We've built this insight into our infrastructure planning processes
